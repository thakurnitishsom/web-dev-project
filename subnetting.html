    <h1 class="subnet-head">Subnetting</h1>
    <h2 class="subnet-heading">Let's understand Subnetting </h2>
    <p class="subnet-para">Subnetting is a fundamental notion for an efficient network administration and once the methodology is well understood, it is practically easy to implement it. We are tackling the case of IPv4 (32 bits, 4 decimal octets separated each by a dot, e.g 192.16.185.12). Every address is composed of two parts: network prefix and host prefix. Two devices that belong to the same network have the same network prefix. 
        In order to determine this more specifically see [4] and [5] below.</p>
    <h1 class="subnet-heading" >What is subnetting?</h1>
    <p class="subnet-para" >The general form of an address within a network is <b>prefix + host number</b>. When we subnet, we try to create networks inside of a network. The network prefix cannot be changed but we have a range of host numbers that will vary depending on the machine and that consist of its identifier. So, our point of start is the host number, from which we can borrow some bits to define a subnet via a <b>subnet number:</b> the new identifier of this subnet is <b>old network prefix + subnet number</b> which is comparable to what was previously seen in the initial situation as network prefix. 
        This proves that we are designing a (sub-)network inside of a network by extending the identification so that it becomes more customized.</p>
    <p class="subnet-para">The network prefix of the newly created subnet is now the old network prefix+subnet number. So, two machines having this same prefix belong to the same subnet.
        Subnetting can also be referred to as VLSM; Variable Length Subnetting Mask. This name indicates the variance of the mask length depending on the number of hosts present in your subnet.</p>
    <h1 class="subnet-heading" >Why is Subnetting useful?</h1>
    <p class="subnet-para">Subnetting helps allocate the IP addresses more efficiently and thus enhances routing efficiency. It helps create structures within a bigger one. Take the example of a corporation or a university; having multiple networks inside of a bigger one helps administrators optimize the communication between groups and minimize unnecessary communication outside of a certain group (which can be more difficult to handle when considering a single network that englobes these different groups). If you study in the faculty of electrical engineering, 
        your e-mail address is most probably different from the e-mail address of a student from the faculty of informatics for a better customization of the information being sent.This also applies to subnetting.</p>
    <p class="subnet-para">Suppose that we want to connect some computers on a network while ensuring that each one lies within a specific subnet. This is the case mentioned above of students from the same university but from different departments.</p>
    <p class="subnet-para"> We dispose of a pool of possible IP addresses (let us denote them by q) and we want to allocate them effectively to each subnet such that we create multiple networks inside of the original big network. This can only be done if we are able to allocate
        IP addresses to all the end points available. You can later check the ‚ÄúPractical Situation‚Äù and [3] from ‚ÄúNetwork Fundamentals‚Äù below to see how this is done.</p>
    
     <p class="subnet-para">When this condition is ensured, we are off to go!<br>
        The first step consists of starting with the subnet with the highest number of end points. The reason behind this can be explained through this example:</p>
    <p class="subnet-para">If 5 buses üöå (having 20, 5,15,3,2 passengers respectively) arrive at the same time in front of a hotel having 40 rooms, it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs impossible to accommodate all of them at once with the additional rule that we give rooms to the whole passengers of the bus or to none at all (we don‚Äôt host partial buses). If we begin with the bus with the largest number till the one with the smallest, we will be able to host 20+15+5 while 5 persons will not find accommodation. 
        On the opposite hand, starting randomly can lead us to 2+3+15+5 and the 20 remaining won‚Äôt find accommodation. It is clear that for an optimal allocation, the first option is the best (even though we wish for everyone to be accommodated üòâ) . This is very similar to IP addresses allocation.</p>
    <p class="subnet-para">By applying this first step to a network, we obtain these before and after pictures:
        Now that we determined which subnet to work on, we are going to determine the number of bits that are necessary to cover our needs. For instance, if we have a subnet of 5 computers, we will need 7 IP addresses (5 for every end point, 1 for the broadcast address and 1 for the network address). To cover these 7 IP addresses,
        3 bits are needed. Since the network prefix is fixed as we mentioned earlier, we can only borrow these 3 bits from our host number that is free to be used for allocation. So, to generalize, considering a number of computers nb, we need to find the smallest n such that 2^n‚â•nb and such that for every n‚Äô< we have 2^n‚Äô  nb.</p>
    <p class="subnet-para">
        Since we only need n bits from the 32 total bits, our new network address is [current network prefix +subnet number + host number]/s, where s = 32 -n the number of bits reserved for the current network prefix +subnet number, i.e the new identifier of the subnet. This calculation of the new number of bits available makes sense because we lost some degrees of freedom when we borrowed bits from the host number in order to uniquely identify the new network.
        Now that we have our addresses, the subnet mask is obtained by placing 1s everywhere starting from the most significant bit except from the nth position where we will have 0s. Feel free to convert it to its decimal form afterwards.</p>
    <p class="subnet-para"><b>WARNING:</b> It is recommended to convert the addresses to their binary form for the upcoming operations to get correct results.</p>
    <p class="subnet-para">The first step being finished and after every end point of the current group has taken its address, we now need to determine the new address that will be used for the next group. In order to do so, we add the binary form of 2^n to the binary form of the subnet address. It is then straightforward to obtain the last IP address of the current subnet by adding the binary form of 2^n ‚Äî 1 to the current subnet address.

        As an extension to the example above, suppose we have a network represented by 192.17.165.0/20, which means we have 12 bits available to be freely allocated to the hosts. An IP address can be written under its binary form following this pattern:
        <br>********.********.****XXXX.XXXXXXXX</p>    
        <p class="subnet-para">Where the bold Xs are the available bits that we can play with and that can be 0 or 1. We start from the end (least significant bit i.e smallest number of end points) and we add up bits until we get the needed number of the given IP addresses. So, in this case we‚Äôll borrow 3 bits from the host portion to build our subnet, and the IP addresses of this network will have this shape:
        <br>********.********.********.*****XXX</p>
    <p class="subnet-para">where we can freely choose to put 0 or 1 in the position of the bold Xs and we‚Äôll still have IP addresses from the same subnet. Check [3] from network fundamentals below for more clarifications.

        <br>It follows that the mask of this network will be 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000 and the last IP address of this subnet is 192.17.165.7 
        <br>
        <br>So, combining these two results (network address and mask), we obtain the network address of the next subnet which in this case is 192.17.165.8/29.
        <br>
        <br>Starting from this newly calculated IP address and network prefix, we repeat the process with the remaining groups until we have no groups left.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subnet-para"><b>Practical situation:</b></h2>

    <p class="subnet-para">We dispose of an IP address scope of 180.34.128.0/20; this means that we theoretically dispose of 12 free bits to allocate to computers (the mask is 255.255.240.0). The number of computers that can be connected is 2¬π¬≤ = 4092.<br>

        <br>In our case, suppose we have a total of 2168 end systems. So, we dispose of the sufficient range to allocate an IP address to each one of them such that they belong to the same network. However, we want to build 8 different networks within the mentioned IP address scope.
        This is possible if we follow the subnetting addressing scheme rules that allows us to build the desired 8 subnets.</p>
        
        <h2 class="subnet-para"><b>Steps:</b></h2>
    <p class="subnet-para">We want to build 8 subnets (A to H) within the IP address scope 180.34.128.0/20. The couples of (subnet, number of end systems) consist of: (A,285), (B,311), (C,492), (D,377), (E,147), (F,434), (G,32) and (H,90). For each subnet, we will need [number of end systems+2] IP addresses.<br>
        <br>
        We will also need 8 other subnets related to the Point-to-Point connection between the routers (ethernet links). Those specific subnets will support 4 IP addresses each, composed of 2 reserved IP addresses and 2 for the Serial links in both ways (for example, from A to B and from B to A).<br>
        <br>
        The first step consists of sorting the subnets in a descending order with respect to the number of end systems:
        <br>
        <b>[C] ‚Äî[ F] ‚Äî[ D] ‚Äî[ B] ‚Äî[ A] ‚Äî[ E] ‚Äî[ H] ‚Äî[ G] ‚Äî[ 8 Point-to-Point networks]</b><br>
        <br>
        The second step consists of finding the necessary number of bits for a full allocation starting from the subnet with the largest number of end points.<br>
        <br>
        For C, F, D, B and A, the closest number that covers the end points is 512 which means 9 bits for each group.<br>
        <br>
        For E, we will need 8 bits. For H, we will need 7 bits. For G we will need 6 bits. And lastly for the 8 Point-to-Point networks we will need 2 bits. So, starting with C, 
        the IP address scope we were given and applying the previously mentioned algorithm, we will get the following design:</p>
        
        <h2 class="subnet-para"><b>Network fundamentals:</b></h2>
    <p class="subnet-para"><b>
        [1] What is an IP address?<</b>
        <br>IP addresses are assigned to end points that belong to a network and that use the internet protocol to communicate.
        The IP address can follow the IPv4 or IPv6 fashion (the first is for 32-bit addresses and the second for 128-bit addresses, so it is clear that IPv6 has a wider range).</p>
    
    <p class="subnet-para"><b>
        [2] What is a mask?</b>
        <br>A mask is written on 32 bits and is used to specify the available addresses for end points on a network. As a result, having the mask and the network address will allow us to know both the number of hosts that can be tied to the network and the pool of IP addresses from which we can allocate an address to any end point that will join the network.
    </p>
            
    <p class="subnet-para"><b>
        [3] How to determine the number of devices that can be connected within a network?</b>
        <br>A network is characterized with a mask (number of bits at our disposal for allocation) and since a network can only include a limited number of devices, the mask should tell us which end points with which IP addresses belong to it. A mask of 255.255.255.0 is capable of allocating 256 IP addresses ranging from 0 until 255. In fact with an IP address of this format ***.***.***.XXX 
         we will always remain within the network if we change the last decimal octet (XXX), such a network has a corresponding mask of 255.255.255.0.<br>
        <br>When we have the mask of our network, we can determine the number of end points it can host using the following methods:

        <br><b>1.</b> Using the decimal form: (256-X1)*(256-X2)*(256-X3)*(256-X4), where the general form of the mask is X1.X2.X3.X4
        <br><b>2.</b> Using the binary form: Convert the mask to its binary form and calculate 2^n where n stands for number of zeros in the mask.<br>
        <br>
        <b>NOTE:</b> Don‚Äôt forget to subtract 2 (broadcast and network addresses which are reserved) from the obtained number to get the number of end points.</p>
    <P class="subnet-para"><b>
        [4] How to know if two IP addresses belong to the same network?</b>
        <br>Given two IP addresses, we can determine if they belong to the same network under the condition that we dispose of the mask. Suppose that a PC A with an IP address 196.15.12.1 is on a network of a mask 255.255.255.0. 
        How do we know if a PC B with an IP address 196.15.12.156 is on the same network as PC A?<br>
        <br>
        <b>1  </b>Convert the mask to binary, i.e write it as 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
        <br><b>2  </b> the same for the two IP addresses, we obtain <br>11000010.00001111.00001100.00000001 and <br>11000010.00001111.00001100.00011100
        <br><b>3 </b>We then multiply the mask with each address and we get for both of them the same result: 11000010.00001111.00001100.00000000 . This is the address of the network they belong to and since it‚Äôs the same , this means they belong to the same network.<br>
    
        <br>To explain further the role of a mask, and to prove that the intuition of looking to similarities of IP addresses is erroneous, let‚Äôs consider a network with a different mask: 255.255.255.254 and its binary version <br>11111111.111111111.11111111.11111110<br>
        <br>The IP addresses of the PCs are the same, so with a multiplication we get different results: 11000010.00001111.00001100.00000000 and 11000010.00001111.00001100.00011100 which proves that for a network with this mask, PC B cannot be on the same network as PC A.</P>

        <P class="subnet-para"><b>[5] What is the notation XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/YY in IP addresses?</b>
        <br>The /YY notation is interchangeable with the mask (specifying one or the other is sufficient). This notation gives us the network address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (the first address ever in the available scope) and /YY specifies the length of the network prefix. So, in order to determine the available bits for hosts we should calculate 32-YY. 
        And since the mask will give us an idea about the available bits for host allocation that‚Äôs why, after specifying the network address, they are both interchangeable.
