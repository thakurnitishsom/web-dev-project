    <p class="subnet-para">
        a computer network is a group of computers that are linked together through a communication channel.
        <!-- img1 will be here -->
        <br>
        <br>All the computer devices are called hosts or end systems. Hosts sending requests are called clients while
        hosts receiving requests are called servers. End systems are connected together by a network of communication
        links and packet switches. Communication links are made up of different types of physical media, including
        coaxial cable, copper wide, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit data at different
        rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second. When one end system has data to send to
        another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The
        resulting packages of information, known as packets, are then sent through the network to the destination end
        system, where they are reassembled into the original data.
        A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on
        one of its outgoing communication links. Common packet switches are routers and link-layer switches.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subnet-para"><b>Internet Protocols</b></h2>
    <p class="subnet-para">End systems, packet switches and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the
        sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the
        Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important protocols in the Internet.
        The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among router and end systems. The
        Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP.</p>
    <!-- img2 will be here -->
    <p class="subnet-para">
        Given the importance of protocols to the Internet, it’s important that everyone agrees on what each and every
        protocol does, so that people can create systems and products that interoperate. Internet standards are
        developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) into documents called requests for comments (RFCs). RFCs
        tend to be quite technical and detailed. These define protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP, DNS and SMTP. There are
        currently more than 6,000 RFCs.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subnet-para"><b> Layered Architecture</b></h2>
    <p class="subnet-para">
        Internet Protocols are organized in a layered architecture. To explain this, let’s imagine you are trying to
        look for a meme from Google’s image search. The server has the image of your choice stored. Before the server
        sends out that information, it needs to convert that image into a package with all the necessary headers. Once
        it reaches the client, the reverse takes place. The packets have their headers removed in the reverse sequence
        and then converted back to the original data.
        <!-- image 3 will be here -->
    </p>
    <p class="subnet-para">
        Now, to take a step further and look at the individual protocol layers. Below are the common TCP/IP model and
        the more detailed OSI model. For our analogy (and probably the rest of the series), I will stick to the TCP/IP
        model.
    </p>
    <!-- image4 will be here -->
    <p class="subnet-para">
        From the server to the internet, the sequence is top-down. When the server finds the Grumpy Cat image that the
        client requested, it will first convert it to a packet and add the Application Layer header. This protocol
        includes HTTP (which provides for Web document request and transfer), SMTP (which provides for transfer of
        e-mail messages), and FTP (which provides for the transfer of file between two end systems). After that, the
        Transport Layer protocol adds the necessary changes. This later transports application-layer messages between
        application endpoints. Common Transport Layer protocols are TCP (which provides connection-oriented services to
        its applications) and UDP (which provides connection-less services to its applications). The Network Layer comes
        right after. This protocol is responsible for moving network-layer packets or datagrams from one host to
        another.
        Finally, the Network Access Layer takes care of the transfer across the communication links. Once the server
        receives the package, the entire process takes place in reverse (bottom-up) to transform the packets back to the
        original image.
